## Genome Families

* Insect Resistance genes or Immune system genes.

* Reproductive genetics and Developmental gene families. 

* Vision associated gene families.

* Repetitive elements.

* Detoxification and metabolism genes.

## Guidelines

**Based on the identified gene family above;** 

Describe the function of the family.

Identify the gene families present in the Hippoboscas.

Describe functional domains in the identified in genes abd compare them with those of the closest species' genes.

Describe the conserved binding sites of the functional domains.

Describe the amino acid residues that determines the functionality of the proteins.

Analyse the gene family contraction and expansion.

Phylogenitic analysis of the gene family.

_NB:_ Explain any unique patterns and observations.
